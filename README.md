# NBA_Visualization
Visualization of the NBA and trends created in a Tableau Story. 

Used Tableau to create visualizations of trends seen in the NBA for a final project in CPSC 308 - Enterprise Data Management at Chapman University. Created sheets that include visualizations that were then put into dashboards with similar information.; dashboards were then used to create a final story board.

*Tableau software is required to be downloaded on computer to open dashboards
